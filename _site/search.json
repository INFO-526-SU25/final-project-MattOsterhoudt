    "text": "Analysis plan\n\nQuestion 1\n\n\n\nUsing the team_results data, I will be using the variables wins (w), win percentage (win), and other indicators of tournament advancement (r64, champ, etc.).\nUsing the public_picks data, I will use the cross reference the data from team_results_data and compare the percent of people who picked the team to win finals, final 4, etc. All of those (finals, f4, e8, etc.) are variable names as a percent character.\nI will clean the data by converting character columns to numeric, and also merge both data sets in order to match their round-specific data points for the visualization.\nI will create a new variable that determines the “overall” public popularity. I can do this by creating a new variable that computes the mean of pick percentages. Alternatively, I can compute a weighted score using a mathematical point model system that weighs later rounds as more valuable.\nFinally, I will develop the visualization. I have not decided yet, but I am leaning towards using a histogram, box plot, or scatter plot with a linear regression model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 2\n\n\n\nUsing the team_results data, I will convert the amount of games played by teams into a categorical variable. This variable will be called “Experience level” and will be categorized as low, high, and medium (I may adjust this later).\nUsing the public_picks data, I will revisit the round percentage popularity and compute the variability (using range, standard deviations, mean, etc.)\nUsing the new variables and data, merge the data sets and prepare for visualization.\nUtilize statistical testing and plot data to draw conclusions and interpretation"

This data set contains more variables, such as PAKE (performance against Komputer expectations) and PASE (Performance against seed expectations), along with total historical games teams have played in the tournament as well as how often they have made top 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, finals, and champion.
